# CodeAlpha_CarPricePrediction-with-MachineLearning

# Overview  
This project focuses on predicting the *selling price of used cars* based on various features such as brand, year, fuel type, mileage, and more.  
Using *machine learning regression techniques*, the model learns from historical car data and helps estimate a car’s market value.


# Objectives  
- Collect and analyze car-related data.  
- Train a **regression model** to predict car prices.  
- Perform **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation**.  
- Visualize the results using **Matplotlib**.  
- Understand real-world applications of **machine learning in price prediction**.


# Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – for numerical computation  
- **Scikit-learn** – for model training and evaluation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for data visualization  


# Dataset  
The dataset includes car details like:  
- Car Name  
- Year of Manufacture  
- Present Price  
- Kms Driven  
- Fuel Type  
- Seller Type  
- Transmission  
- Owner  
- Selling Price (Target Variable)
